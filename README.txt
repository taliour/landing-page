This is my second project for The Odin Project (a free online web developemnt course).
It's a simple landing page designed with just html and css using flexbox. It was easier
than expected but making it look pretty and putting everything into the right place with
correct margins was tricky. Hopefully my next project will include some javascript 
to make it interactive. The proffesor pictures are missing because I didn't want to waste
time resizing google photos of them, so I put a placeholder in their place.
